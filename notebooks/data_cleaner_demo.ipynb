        "- Filters chips based on no-data pixel thresholds\n",
        "- Supports different cleaning methods (buffer, limit)\n",
        "- Handles observation point-based cleaning\n",

        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "1. **InstaGeo installed** - Make sure you have InstaGeo properly installed\n",
        "2. **Dataset CSV file** - You can create this by running examples from the [Chip Creator Demo Notebook](chip_creator_demo.ipynb)\n",
        "3. **Generated chips and segmentation maps** - These are created by the chip creator pipeline (see Chip Creator Demo)\n",
        "4. **Observation points CSV** - For segmentation map adjustment (see Chip Creator Demo for observations points)\n",
