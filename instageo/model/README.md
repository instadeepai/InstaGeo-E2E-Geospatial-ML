# InstaGeo - Model

## Overview

The InstaGeo Model component is designed for training, validation and inference using custom deep learning models having [Prithvi_100M](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-100M) foundational model as backbone.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt`

## Features
- Supports both classification and regression tasks
- Accepts both temporal and non-temporal inputs
- Custom models with [Prithvi_100M](https://huggingface.co/ibm-nasa-geospatial/Prithvi-100M) backbone
- Training, Validation and Inference runs
- Sliding window inference for inference on expansive tiles, which measure 3660 x 3660 pixels
- Reproducible training pipeline
- Command-line flags for easy configuration of training parameters.

<!-- ## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
# pip install instageo # this will work when we publish to PyPi
pip install . #run from instageo root
``` -->

## Usage

1. **Setting Up Run Arguments:** Configure the training parameters using command-line arguments.

    - `root_dir`: Root directory of the dataset.
    - `valid_filepath`: File path for validation data.
    - `train_filepath`: File path for training data.
    - `test_filepath`: File path for test data.
    - `checkpoint_path`: File path for model checkpoint.
    - `learning_rate`: Initial learning rate.
    - `num_epochs`: Number of training epochs.
    - `batch_size`: Batch size for training and validation.
    - `mode`: Select stats, train, eval, sliding_inference or chip_inference mode.

See `configs/config.yaml` for more.

2. **Dataset Preparation:** Prepare your geospatial data using the InstaGeo Chip Creator or similar and place it in the specified `root_dir`. Ensure that the csv file for each dataset has `Input` and `Label` columns corresponding to the path of the image and label relative to the `root_dir`. Additionally, ensure the data is compatible with `InstaGeoDataset`

3. **Training the Model:**

Run training with the necessary flags:

```bash
python -m instageo.model.run \
    root_dir=path/to/root valid_filepath=path/to/valdata \
    train_filepath=path/to/traindata \
    train.learning_rate=0.001 \
    train.num_epochs=100 \
    train.batch_size=4
```

4. **Prediction using:**

*a.* **Sliding Window Inference:**
For training we create chips from tiles, this is necessary because our model can only process an input of size 224 x 224. For the purpose of inference we have a sliding window inference feature that inputs tile and perform a sliding window inference on patches of size 224 x 224. This is useful because it skips the process of creating chips using the `instageo.data.chip_creator`, we only need to download tiles and directly runs inference on them. We can run inference using the following command:

```bash
python -m instageo.model.run --config-name=config.yaml \
    root_dir='path-to-root_dir-containing-dataset.json' \
    test_filepath='dataset.json' \
    train.batch_size=16 \
    test.stride=224 \
    checkpoint_path='path-to-checkpoint' \
    mode=sliding_inference
```

*b.* **Chip Inference:**
This mode performs efficient and optimized inference on geospatial image "chips" using a pre-trained model. It processes the data in batches, makes predictions, and saves the results as TIFF files with the appropriate geospatial metadata. It uses GPU (if available) and multithreading to save files faster.

*Note:* The image size used for training and chip inference must be the same (currently 224) due to preprocessing steps applied during training.

```bash
python -m instageo.model.run --config-name=config.yaml \
    root_dir='path-to-root_dir-containing-dataset.json' \
    test_filepath='dataset.json' \
    train.batch_size=16 \
    test.stride=224 \
    checkpoint_path='path-to-checkpoint' \
    mode=chip_inference
```



5. **Example (Flood Mapping):**
[Sen1Floods11](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11) is a geospatial dataset of 10m Sentinel-2 imagery for flood detection.
- Data: Download the Sen1Floods11 hand labelled Sentinel-2 chips as well as `train`, `validation` and `test` splits using the following command
```bash
mkdir sen1floods11
mkdir sen1floods11/S2Hand
mkdir sen1floods11/LabelHand

gsutil cp gs://instageo/data/sen1floods11/flood_train_data.csv sen1floods11
gsutil cp gs://instageo/data/sen1floods11/flood_test_data.csv sen1floods11
gsutil cp gs://instageo/data/sen1floods11/flood_valid_data.csv sen1floods11

gsutil -m rsync -r gs://sen1floods11/v1.1/data/flood_events/HandLabeled/S2Hand sen1floods11/S2Hand
gsutil -m rsync -r gs://sen1floods11/v1.1/data/flood_events/HandLabeled/LabelHand sen1floods11/LabelHand
```

- Model: Fine-tune Prithvi on the dataset by running the following command
```bash
python -m instageo.model.run --config-name=sen1floods11 \
    root_dir=sen1floods11 \
    train_filepath=sen1floods11/flood_train_data.csv \
    valid_filepath=sen1floods11/flood_valid_data.csv \
    train.num_epochs=100
```
After training you are expected to have a checkpoint with mIoU of ~ 89%

- Evaluate: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on test set using the following command.
Replace `path/to/checkpoint/checkpoint.ckpt` with the path to your model checkpoint.
```bash
python -m instageo.model.run --config-name=sen1floods11 \
    root_dir=sen1floods11 test_filepath=sen1floods11/flood_test_data.csv \
    checkpoint_path=path/to/checkpoint/checkpoint.ckpt \
    mode=eval
```
When the saved checkpoint is evaluated on the test set, you should have results comparable to the following

## Customization

- Use the `stats` mode to compute the `mean`, and `std` lists of your dataset.
- Modify the `bands`, `mean`, and `std` lists in `configs/config.yaml` to match your dataset's characteristics and improve its normalization.
- Implement additional data augmentation strategies in `process_and_augment`.
